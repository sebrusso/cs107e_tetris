## Title of your project
Tetris - Smart Glove Controlled 

## Team members
Devon Smith
Sebastian Russo
Nick Reisner

## Project description
In this project, we build a Tetris emulator with optimized gl in C. In addition to a fully-featured
Tetris game, we implement a glove peripheral for hand control of the falling block. We use 
gyroscope and acceleromator information through I2C to measure hand movement. 

## Hardware, budget
We bought two sensors and a glove, for a total of about 50 dollars, 
which is under the budget for three people (60 dollars.)

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Sebastian - optimizing GL library, Tetris graphics, gameplay mechaincs, glove performace
Nick - setting up V1, Tetris grahics, gameplay mechanics, glove performance
Devon - hardware interfacing, glove development, fine-tuning glove performance

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
Next week, by lab, we hope to achieve a V3 Tetris game with most features and to 
have begun the interfacing process with the glove/hardware. 

## Resources needed, issues
TBD
