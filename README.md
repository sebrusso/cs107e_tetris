## Project:
Glove-controlled Tetris

## Team members
Nick Reisner, Sebastian Russo, Devon Smith

## Project description
In this project, we build a Tetris emulator with optimized gl in C. In addition to a fully-featured Tetris game, we implement a glove peripheral for hand control of the falling block. We use gyroscope and acceleromator information through I2C to measure hand movement.

Below is a link to some clips taken during development. We were unfortunately unable to get a video of the final version we brought to the project showcase. The two versions we brought to the project showcase (accelerometer and keyboard versions) are here on github. If you want to give our Tetris a try, the keyboard version should build with the files included in the "keyboard_version" directory.
